# CSDM Java Developer Assignment

The Goal of this application is to be able to distribute data from different feeds including images to clients.
 
Therefore, create a Java application that polls a news feed in a freely configurable interval and stores the data in an SQL database.
 
The feed to be used is http://feeds.nos.nl/nosjournaal?format=xml. The application should store at least last 10 items including title, description, publication data and image.
 
For the clients to be able to retrieve the data, expose it through an API of your choice (for example REST or GraphQL).
 
Furthermore, it is important that the implementation is easily extendable to consume feeds from different sources in different formats and expose them to the consumers in a homogenous way.
 
At the end you should deliver an SQL script which can be used to create the SQL database. As well as a readme which describes how to set up and run the application and the source code.
